Send emails from Node.js, easy as cake.

## Gigabyte attachments

Version 1.0 is a total rewrite from the ground up and relying heavily on Streams2. This allows you to reliably
send messages with gigabyte attachments even through a slow network connection without CPU or memory penalties. You probably do not need to but if you'd like for some reason it is totally possible.
